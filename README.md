Password Complexity Checker

This Python script evaluates the complexity of a password based on various criteria such as the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. It categorizes passwords into three levels of strength: Weak, Moderate, and Strong.

Usage
1. Input: Users can input a password string when prompted by the script.
2. Output: The script then analyzes the password and prints its strength level.

   
Strength Levels

->Weak: Passwords that do not meet minimum complexity requirements.

->Moderate: Passwords with a combination of uppercase or lowercase letters, digits, and special characters but may not meet all requirements for a strong password.

->Strong: Passwords that meet all complexity requirements, including a minimum length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

How it Works

1. The script iterates through each character of the input password, checking for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

3. Based on the presence of these elements and the length of the password, it determines the strength level of the password.
  
5. The script then prints the strength level of the password.
